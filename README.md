# Icarus_Game_Manager
An Excel Workbook &amp; associated vba routines to manage various aspects of the game Icarus-First Cohort

#Program Description

Welcome to the Icarus Game Manager!

This Excel Workbook and associated vba routines was originally developed as a project of mine to allow me to manage 
various aspects of the survival/building game - Icarus - First Cohort.

I have been playing the game for quite some time and when the developers released the Data Decentralization (Week #53 Update)
along with the Beta Dedicated Server app, I began messing with the local files on my PC to see what was possible, using 
my vba coding skills. 

The Icarus Game Manager is a collection of utilities and worksheets that allow the following in the game:

    - Icarus character information - Import, change, and export:
